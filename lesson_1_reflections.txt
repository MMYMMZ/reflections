How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    By doing that we gonna know easily where the changes exactly
    where made and undo it or fix it.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because this allow me to see all my progress in one place so i can
    change what i like undo till the bug fixed.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    the pros is that am gonna be able to save checkpoints i might need in the
    future BUT here come the cons that i might forget to commit what i done.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because that's will show us the change we made and it's effect's on
    the rest of the project.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    First gonna use git log to see recent commits that been made after that
    gonna compare 2 commints using git diff to see changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Very confident because i always have backup.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Aandroid Development.
