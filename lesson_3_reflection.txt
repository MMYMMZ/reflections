When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	when the project i am working on needs to cooperate with others developers	
	and work at the same time or i need help from a far distance developer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	to have the freedom of choice which commits be in the project and which not
	and to prevent the project from corruption.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks: is an online copy of a repository on GitHub.
	clones: is a local copy of online repository.
	branches: is a copy of the repository in the repository to test new features
	without messing up with the original and when it ready merge it to master. 
	When to use it in situations like described before.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	to have the ability of see the changed others did in the remote and choice to	
	add it or not to my local repo.
