When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	when the project i am working on needs to cooperate with others developers	
	and work at the same time or i need help from a far distance developer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	to have the freedom of choice which commits be in the project and which not
	and to prevent the project from corruption.
